 Using TCP protocol and two computers, one being local computer and other being a remote computer, replicates the "home" directory structure from the local computer onto the remote computer as "home-backup". The home and home-backup could be replaced with any directory name. Once the directory structure is replicated, all the files are copied from "home" to "home-backup" at their respective places/locations.
